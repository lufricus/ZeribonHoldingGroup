Build a clean, sophisticated, government-grade website for “Zeribon Holding Group,” a veteran-led U.S. government contracting company. The design must be trustworthy, elegant, minimal, and highly professional. Use deep navy (#0A1A3E), federal blue (#051124), white (#FFFFFF), steel gray (#6F7A86), and silver (#DDE3EB). Use Montserrat for headings and Inter for body text. The layout must feel like a federal contractor: clean hero sections, large typography, disciplined spacing, and balanced white space.
